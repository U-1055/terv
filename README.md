# terv
Terv is a task-tracker for small working groups, like start-ups. It has been in development since the end of December 2025 as a part of the project "Developing of an automated planning system". Now it can:
1. Create your personal reminders and simple notes.
2. Show your tasks and events scheduled this day.
3. Show information about tasks and events.
4. Show information about an object by click on its ID.
   
Now I develop the task-list.

The stack is Python 3.12,  Pyside (Qt Widgets), Flask, SQLAlchemy (with SQLite).
